# Configure me

This crate aims to help with reading configuration of application from files,
environment variables and command line arguments, merging it together and
validating. It auto-generates most of the code for you based on configuration (heh)
file. It creates a struct for you, which contains all the parsed and validated
fields, so you can access the information quickly easily and idiomatically.

This is currently only a facade for the dependencies, the core of the crate is in
`configure_me_codegen` crate.

**Important:** In order to use this crate, you need to create a build script using
`configure_me_codegen` to generate the code that will use this crate! See the example.


Wait a second, why this crate doesn't use derive?
-------------------------------------------------

I'd love to use derive. Unfortunately it doesn't compose well with man page generation and other tooling.

For a longer version, see [docs/why\_not\_derive.md](docs/why_not_derive.md)

Example
-------

Let's say, your application needs these parametrs to run:

* Port - this is mandatory
* IP address to bind to - defaults to 0.0.0.0
* Path to TLS certificate - optional, the server will be unsecure if not given
* RunFast - switch, if present the server will run in fast mode

First create `config_spec.toml` configuration file specifying all the parameters:

```toml
[[param]]
# short param, e.g -p
abbr = "p"
# long arg, e.g --port
name = "port"
type = "u16"
optional = false

# This text will be used in the documentation (help etc)
# It's not mandatory, but your progam will be ugly without it.
doc = "Port to listen on."

[[param]]
name = "bind_addr"
# Yes, this works and  you can use your own T: Deserialize + ParseArg as well!
# merge from env var. e.g BIND_ADDR
env_var = true
type = "::std::net::Ipv4Addr"
default = "::std::net::Ipv4Addr::new(0, 0, 0, 0)" # Rust expression that creates the value
doc = "IP address to bind to."

[[param]]
name = "tls_cert"
type = "::std::path::PathBuf"
doc = "Path to the TLS certificate. The connections will be unsecure if it isn't provided."
# optional = true is the default, no need to add it here
# If the type is optional, it will be represented as Option<T>
# e.g. Option<::std::path::PathBuf> in this case.

[[switch]]
# switches are parsed as bools, true if present false otherwise
name = "run_fast"
doc = "Will make the server run in fast mode"
```

Then, create a simple build script:

```rust
extern crate configure_me;

fn main() {
    configure_me::build_script_auto().unwrap_or_exit();
}
```

Add dependencies to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[packge]
#Â ...
build = "build.rs"

# This tells auto build script and other tools where to look for your specificcation
[package.metadata.configure_me]
spec = "config_spec.toml"

[dependencies]
configure_me = "0.3"

[build-dependencies]
configure_me_codegen = "0.3"
```

And finally add appropriate incantations into `src/main.rs`:

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate configure_me;

include_config!();

fn main() {
    // This will read configuration from "/etc/my_awesome_server/server.conf" file and
    // the command-line arguments.
    let (server_config, _remaining_args) = Config::including_optional_config_files(&["/etc/my_awesome_server/server.conf]").unwrap_or_exit();

    // Your code here
    // E.g.:
    let listener = std::net::TcpListener::bind((server_config.bind_addr, server_config.port)).expect("Failed to bind socket");
}
```
Configuration
-------------
Configuration of the code generation is set in the same toml file as the specification
```toml
[general]
# Prefix for all env vars - enables all env vars by default if present
build = "build.rs"

# The name of the parameter which, if specified causes parameter parsing to
# immediately load a config file, parse it, and override all configuration
# provided so far with that file.
conf_file_param = "/path/to/conf/file.toml"
```

If you need to generate different files for multiple binaries, create a separate file for each binary and then define them separately in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package.metadata.configure_me.bin]
# config for binary foo
foo = "foo_config_spec.toml"
# config for binary bar
bar = "bar_config_spec.toml"
```

And include the file in `foo` like this:

```rust
include_config!("foo");
```

This needs to be specific because there's no way to detect binary name.

Manual page generation
----------------------

The crate exports an interface for generating manual pages, but I recommend you to not worry about it.
There's a [tool](https://github.com/Kixunil/cfg_me) for generating extra files (currently only man page) from your specification. You can install it using `cargo`.

After installing it, you can type `cfg_me man` to see the generated man page. Run `cfg_me -o program_name.1 man` to save it to a file.

Debconf generation
------------------

This crate also contains experimental debconf support behind `debconf` feature. It generates `templates`, `configure` and `postinst` files for you. If you plan to package your application, you can use it. Note that this isn't integrated with `cargo-deb` yet.

In order to use this feature, you must enable the flag in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
configure_me_codegen = { version = "0.3.11", features = ["debconf"] }
```

Then add debconf options to your configuration specification:

```toml
[debconf]
# Sets the name of the package
# Enables debconf support
package_name = "my-awesome-app"

[[param]]
name = "port"
type = "u16"
optional = false
# Documentation IS mandatory for debconf!
doc = "Port to listen on."
# Priority used for debconf questions
# "high" is recommended for non-default, mandatory questions
# In case of missing priority, the option is skipped!
debconf_priority = "high"

[[param]]
name = "bind_addr"
type = "::std::net::Ipv4Addr"
default = "::std::net::Ipv4Addr::new(0, 0, 0, 0)" # Rust expression that creates the value
doc = "IP address to bind to."
debconf_priority = "low"
# The default set by debconf. While it might seem redundant, this way the user sees the
# default value when editing.
debconf_default = "0.0.0.0"

[[param]]
name = "tls_cert"
type = "String"
doc = "Path to the TLS certificate. The connections will be unsecure if it isn't provided."
debconf_priority = "medium"
```

Finally build your application with `DEBCONF_OUT` environment variable set to existing directory
where `configure_me` should generate the files.

Planned features
----------------

This crate is unfinished and there are features I definitelly want:

* Support for documenting your configuration very well - done
* Support environment variables - done
* Generate bash completion
* Some advanced features

Comparison with clap
--------------------

`clap` is a great crate that works well. Unfortunately, it doesn't support reading from config files. It also has stringly-typed API, which adds boilerplate and (arguably small, but non-zero) runtime overhead.

On the other hand, it's much more mature and supports some features, this crate doesn't (bash completion and native subcommands).

`clap` may be more suitable for programs that should be easy to work with from command line, `configure_me` may be better for long-running processes with a lot of configuration options.
